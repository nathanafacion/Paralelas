 *   MD5 Benchmark
 *   -------------
 *   File: md5_bmark.c
 *
 *   This is the main file for the md5 benchmark kernel. This benchmark was
 *   written as part of the StarBENCH benchmark suite at TU Berlin. It performs
 *   MD5 computation on a number of self-generated input buffers in parallel,
 *   automatically measuring execution time.

Por meio do vtune podemos ver que a funcao run eh a que poderia ser alterada de forma a trazer ganho a aplicacao.
Com isso alteramos a run e obtivemos os resultados acima, por meio dos resultados podemos ver que o ganho realmente
foi significativo para o md5.

         | software's instructions are both categorized under Core Bound. Hence

         | execution units are overloaded or dependencies in program's data- or

            Divider: 0.0% of Clockticks
            Port Utilization: 48.7% of Clockticks
             | This metric represents a fraction of cycles during which an
             | application was stalled due to Core non-divider-related issues.
             | For example, heavy data-dependency between nearby instructions,
             | or a sequence of instructions that overloads specific ports.
             | Hint: Loop Vectorization - most compilers feature auto-
             | Vectorization options today - reduces pressure on the execution
             | ports as multiple elements are calculated with same uop.

                Cycles of 1 Port Utilized: 48.1% of Clockticks
                 | This metric represents cycles fraction where the CPU executed
                 | total of 1 uop per cycle on all execution ports. This can be
                 | due to heavy data-dependency among software instructions, or
                 | oversubscribing a particular hardware resource. In some other
                 | cases with high 1_Port_Utilized and L1 Bound, this metric can
                 | point to L1 data-cache latency bottleneck that may not
                 | necessarily manifest with complete execution starvation (due
                 | to the short L1 latency e.g. walking a linked list) - looking
                 | at the assembly can be helpful. Note that this metric value
                 | may be highlighted due to L1 Bound issue.

    Back-End Bound: 54.8% of Pipeline Slots
     | Identify slots where no uOps are delivered due to a lack of required
     | resources for accepting more uOps in the back-end of the pipeline. Back-
     | end metrics describe a portion of the pipeline where the out-of-order
     | scheduler dispatches ready uOps into their respective execution units,
     | and, once completed, these uOps get retired according to program order.
     | Stalls due to data-cache misses or stalls due to the overloaded divider
     | unit are examples of back-end bound issues.
     |
        Memory Bound: 22.4% of Pipeline Slots
         | The metric value is high. This can indicate that the significant
         | fraction of execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand
         | memory load and stores. Use Memory Access analysis to have the metric
         | breakdown by memory hierarchy, memory bandwidth information,
         | correlation by memory objects.

            L1 Bound: 11.8% of Clockticks
             | This metric shows how often machine was stalled without missing
             | the L1 data cache. The L1 cache typically has the shortest
             | latency. However, in certain cases like loads blocked on older
             | stores, a load might suffer a high latency even though it is
             | being satisfied by the L1. Note that this metric value may be
             | highlighted due to DTLB Overhead or Cycles of 1 Port Utilized
             | issues.

                Loads Blocked by Store Forwarding: 0.0% of Clockticks
                Lock Latency: 0.0% of Clockticks
                 | A significant fraction of CPU cycles spent handling cache
                 | misses due to lock operations. Due to the microarchitecture
                 | handling of locks, they are classified as L1 Bound regardless
                 | of what memory source satisfied them. Note that this metric
                 | value may be highlighted due to Store Latency issue.

                FB Full: 0.0% of Clockticks
                 | This metric does a rough estimation of how often L1D Fill
                 | Buffer unavailability limited additional L1D miss memory
                 | access requests to proceed. The higher the metric value, the
                 | deeper the memory hierarchy level the misses are satisfied
                 | from. Often it hints on approaching bandwidth limits (to L2
                 | cache, L3 cache or external memory). Avoid adding software
                 | prefetches if indeed memory BW limited.

         | This metric represents how much Core non-memory issues were of a

         | software's instructions are both categorized under Core Bound. Hence
         | it may indicate the machine ran out of an OOO resources, certain
